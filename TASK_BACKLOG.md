# TASK_BACKLOG.md

Purpose: deferred work queue for tasks Bryan wants captured but not necessarily executed now.

## Intake Rules

When Bryan says anything like:
- "remember this task"
- "add this to backlog"
- "someday task"
- "we should do this later"

Bort should run a short intake prompt and then add/refine an entry here.

## Intake Questions (ask only what is missing)

1) What outcome do you want?
2) Priority? (P1 urgent, P2 important, P3 someday)
3) Target timing? (this week / this month / later / specific date)
4) Any constraints or dependencies?
5) What does "done" look like?

If Bryan gives partial info, Bort should infer reasonable defaults and continue.

## Defaults

- priority: P3
- status: someday
- effort: M
- target_window: later
- owner: Bort
